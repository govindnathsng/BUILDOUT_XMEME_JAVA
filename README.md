## üìò Overview
**XMeme** is a backend web application that allows users to post and view memes. This project was developed from scratch, with a focus on designing a robust backend, implementing essential REST APIs, and ensuring smooth data storage and retrieval from MongoDB.

During this project:
- Developed the backend server from scratch using Spring Boot.
- Implemented REST APIs for posting and fetching memes.
- Leveraged Docker for containerized deployment and used MongoDB for data persistence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### **Backend API Development**
#### Scope of Work
- Created a backend server with Spring Boot and implemented necessary REST API handlers.
- Built a **POST API** to allow users to post memes.
- Developed **GET APIs**:
  - To fetch the 100 newest memes with `name`, `caption`, and `image URLs`.
  - To retrieve individual memes by meme ID.

#### Skills Used
- **Spring Boot**, **REST API**, **MongoDB**, **Jackson**

---

### **Data Storage and Error Handling**
#### Scope of Work
- Utilized MongoDB to store meme data, including user `name`, `caption`, and `image URL`.
- Managed error handling with appropriate HTTP response codes for invalid requests.
- Followed MVCS (Model-View-Controller-Service) layering for clear code organization and modularity.

#### Skills Used
- **MongoDB**, **HTTP Response Codes**, **MVCS Architecture**

---

### **Testing and Documentation**
#### Scope of Work
- Tested all implemented functionalities to ensure smooth operation.
- Documented each module with clear comments and followed best practices.

#### Skills Used
- **Unit Testing**, **Swagger for API Documentation**
